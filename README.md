# JDL Bench

A personal monorepo / workbench for Jay Lamb.

## Installation

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/install) is required to build and/or execute software. A simple [Python test program](https://github.com/jaylamb/jdl_bench/tree/main/repository_test) can be executed to verify that things are working as intended.
